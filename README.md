# student_data

## Project Overview
The Student Data Management Page is a simple web application that allows users to view, add, edit, and delete student information. The data is stored locally in the browser, so there is no need for a backend. This project is an excellent way to practice HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as collaboration using GitHub.

## Features
- **Home Page**: Displays a list of students with basic information (name, age, grade) and a search bar to find students by name.
- **Add Student Form**: A form to add a new student with fields for name, age, and grade.
- **Edit Student Form**: A form to edit existing student information.
- **Delete Student**: Option to delete a student from the list.
- **Local Storage**: Uses local storage to save and retrieve student data.
